When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to access it in any place which can communicate with Internet, or safely
	to save it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	There are some reasons:
	1. It cann't be access Internet anytime.
	2. It gives me choice when I want pull changes.
	3. Remote repository will not be always correct or something.
